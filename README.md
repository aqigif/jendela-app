## Performance Analysis : React-Native-Wagmi-Chart
issue : switching time when data already in cache become laggy

1. 1st form
   - using react-query, with normal code
   - the animation looks so nice from rn-wagmi-charts when we change the data 
   - but when switching larger data that already in cache, i got drop fps and frozen frame. :(

3. 2nd form
   - i decide to remove react-query
   - install zustand
   - create two zustand store: 1 for handle data, 2 for handle loading and errors
   - define all charts of every time at once and using absolute position to manage hide and show

3. 3rd form
  - more separate component by making CandlestickChartAtom and CandlestickChartSuperAtom
  - more separate zustand store into 3: 1 for handle data, 2 for handle loading and errors, 3 for handling time switching
  - goal : only once render .map and chart when time switching
  - now when switching larger data that already in cache, it perform better
